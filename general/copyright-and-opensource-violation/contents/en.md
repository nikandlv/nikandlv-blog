### Let me tell you a story

Me and my friend and a group of people created a software for a specific device.
We made it free and open sourced so everyone can enjoy it!

But now another person just took our software and is selling it to other people.

This is how things work in here :)

## Copyright and licence in software industry

Every software comes with a licence and a set of rules, either if source is available or not.
for any digital projects we have some licences that the creator can put in their software for example

* Apache License 2.0
* BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license
* BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" license
* GNU General Public License (GPL)
* GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)
* MIT license
* Mozilla Public License 2.0
* Common Development and Distribution License
* Eclipse Public License

## Software Pirates!

if you live in iran you are probably a pirate even if you dont know it yet!

Every game/software you download or even bought from big companies in iran, or even the windows you installed or came when you bought your pc or laptop is `pirated`, `cracked`, `hacked` or `leaked`!

## It gets even worse!

These huge companies sell these cracked and pirated products.

They even sell the free and open source software without even giving credits to the proper source!

## Issues

### Free Software

If a software is intented to be published for free and open source to anyone. then you can distribute it but you CANNOT sell it for financial gains

for example 7ZIP

### Proprietary software

This type of software is intented to be under controll of its developer and way they want to use it. its closed source and they can either provide it for free or paid.

and people sell the cracked versions of these paid versions.

### "Well i cant buy it!" "They dont sell it to us"

This is exatly like having suger cubes and saying they dont sell us suger so we are going to steal it.

Use free alternatives then.

Or buy it if you can

## The root 

The root of issue is not the consumer its the publishers and distributeur.

They are the one hosting and sharing these softwares illegally.
