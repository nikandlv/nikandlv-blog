The Web is the heart of all the remote communication that we have.
The web is beyond websites and applications.

Let me explain!

### Categories
Consider these two categories

* Web Development
* Web Design

Let's Discuss them one by one

### Web Design

Web Design is the most valuable and important part of what we know as user interface design
Not only it involves the design of user interface but combining it with creativity and taking into consideration the User Experience (also known as UX)

Web design consists of two parts

* UI (User Interface)
* UX (User Experience)

#### UI 
UI designing is the art of creating cool and neat looking designs with different colors and styles.

#### UX
UX is the field of analyzing and optimizing the UI.
Choosing the right colors, Choosing the right styles. Designing as a monkey can work with it!
Of course, this covers a lot of things that affect the outcome of UI
The main goal is to keep things simple and good looking while having ease of use for the user 

Keep in mind that there is no coding here! Just the design and design optimization.

### Web Development

Web development is the heart of the web.
Web development is the field where it involves mostly coding and solving issues in the most efficient way possible. And turning designs and ideas into real things!

Web development consists of two parts

* Back-end
* Front-end

##### Front-end

Frontend in web development is a separate field as a job. 
The frontend developer needs some required skills like 

`HTML` `CSS` `Javascript`

 and the frameworks that are written on these languages. Some of the popular ones are as follows 
 
 `JQuery` `Bootstrap` `Material-UI frameworks` `ReactJS‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍` `AngularJS` `VueJS` 
 
 and more …

The job of this developer is to turn the design into code and connect the necessary things to the backend

##### Back-end

Backend is the core and working mind of the web!
Backend is not just the development of website backend, a backend developer has a wider range of tools and fields to choose from.
Heres a list of things that backend developers do

* Website backends
* Application backends
* Game servers
* API’s
* Performance Optimizations
* Cloud Messaging servers
* Internal Microservice designs
* Database design and data science 
* Load balancers
* Custom protocols on TCP/UDP
* RPC

As it seems its a BIG BIG field to major in and of course there is a lot of technology that a person can choose from!

But this does not make any boundaries, people follow what they love and may know and borrow these skills!

We will discuss these majors in separate posts

Stay tuned for more posts about this topic
In the future, we will discuss about Fullstack Developers
