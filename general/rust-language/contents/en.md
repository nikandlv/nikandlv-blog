# Rust language

Lets talk about an awesome language

### Before we start

### Why rust?

There are a lot of reasons to choose rust.

lets examine the key points.

### **Performance**

> Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages. - official website

Rust is absolutely one of the best languages that provides memory efficiency in a reliable and efficient way.

It has no runtime overhead and it can be used in IOT and bare metal!

You can bind it with different languages and shared modules and libraries.

Look at these benchmarks of an HTTP API i wrote


![Rust API Benchmark](https://nikandlv.ir/uploads/files/3//benchmark.png)

This is on a low-end server with heavy load on other services

* 8GB of ram
* Core I3

261 Thousand requests in 1 second

13 Million 873 Thousand requests in 1 minute

Impressive huh!

### **Reliability**

> Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

Rust provides one of the best compile time experiences

Type system of rust prevents a lot of bugs and memory issues, overflows and handles the type conversion.

Rust handles concurrency in an efficient and easy way. also there is unofficial support for green threads

### **Productivity**

> Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.

Rust makes your coding experience a lot better, it provides really convenient features that i think every language needs!

Rust package manager is called cargo, its nice and easy to use 

## Where we can use rust?

* CLI
* Networking
* Embedded Devices and IOT
* WebAssembly

### **Cons**

* Harder learning curve then other languages
* Its still young

## Conclusion

Rust is language that is best at performance so if you need the last drop of performance go for it!
